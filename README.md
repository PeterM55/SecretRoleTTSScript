# SecretRoleTTSScript
This is a script for tabletop simulator for a deception game called secret role game. 

This script is written in lua and I did not write all of it, I simply made edits. 
I do not plan to make more changes to this repository, but I will update the script on here soon as it is out of date. I had originally just created this to upload it one time for a person who wanted to see the code. But I should keep it up to date. 

At the time of writing this it has 1,105 subscribers and many more using it.
